Supplementary Digital Content for the Prosthetics and Orthotics International Publication:

**Understanding the Effects of Suspension Systems on Lower-Limb Prosthesis Rotation**

This repo contains the STL files for the above publication, which correspond to a **mock transtibial (TT) residual limb** and associated **HOLO**, **Pin-lock**, and **Vacuum** sockets.
The model files are separated for ease of manufacture:

- SDC-1 : Bone insert
- SDC-2 : 3D scan of the Residual limb
- SDC-3 : 3D scan of the Casted Residual limb (with liner)
- SDC-4 : HOLO socket
- SDC-5 : Pin-lock socket
- SDC-6 : Vacuum socket
